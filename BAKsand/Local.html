                                <p> Our Competitive Regional group is designed for those athletes who have outgrown our Club group but are not yet ready to test their game at the national level. Many athletes in this group have aspirations of playing for their high school teams and want the skills to be able to do so. These athletes are on track to eventually join our Competitive Travel group should they choose to do so, but are not required to do so.
                                    Our Competitive Local group participates in local doubles tournaments to learn the ins and outs of competing at a high level but does not travel to out of state events, club vs club events, and national events. Our alternates for Club be Club events will be selected from this group ONLY if our National team players are unable to make it to an event.
                                    Basic strategies, game flow, and specific communication are solidified in this group as the core of great volleyball is built. In this program, you have the option to commit to the entire season at a discounted price and with other perks, or attend month to month.
