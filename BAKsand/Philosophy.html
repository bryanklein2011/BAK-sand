                  I see in each of them. They have never been trained based on their potential before so they will be forced to be uncomfortable all the time. Their job is to step up and be comfortable with comfortability.
                  We are raising the bar here at New Mexico Premier. We have to set up game like situations where they are
                  going to struggle and test their limits. This helps the athletes learn to adapt to positive change and learn about themselves on the way.
                  We don't want to see what you can do today, we want see what you're capable of doing when we raise the bar". </h3>
